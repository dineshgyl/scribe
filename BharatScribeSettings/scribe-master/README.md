# ~ scribe ~ Entware syslog-ng and logrotate installer for Asuswrt-Merlin

**scribe** is a **syslog-ng** and **logrotate** installer for ASUS routers running **Asuswrt-Merlin**

## v3.2.6
### Updated on 2025-Dec-22

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

1. [Asuswrt-Merlin](https://asuswrt.lostrealm.ca/ "Pure Freaking Magic") running on a supported ASUS router
2. **Entware** installed, preferably using [amtm](https://github.com/decoderman/amtm "amtm")
3. jffs scripts enabled in the firmware; this can be set manually, and installing **Entware** via amtm usually takes care of it

* **scribe** includes handlers for the logs created by [skynet](https://github.com/Adamm00/IPSet_ASUS "skynet"); if you wish to use these handlers, it is advised to install **skynet** first.  If **skynet** is installed after scribe, you will have to re-run the installation and force installation.

### Installing

SSH into the router and run:
```bash
/usr/sbin/curl --retry 3 "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AMTM-OSR/scribe/master/scribe.sh" -o "/jffs/scripts/scribe" && chmod 0755 /jffs/scripts/scribe && /jffs/scripts/scribe install
```

## Built With

* [vim](https://www.vim.org/ "definitely NOT emacs") - because vi is always there, so I'm not lost on a clean install.
* amix's [vimrc](https://github.com/amix/vimrc) - basic version.
